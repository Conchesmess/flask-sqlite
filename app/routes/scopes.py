# This file lists the Google "scopes" needed for login.
# Scopes are permissions that tell Google what the app can do with your account.
# For example, reading your email or profile info.

# These are the main scopes used for logging in:
scopes = [
    'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email',  # Read your email
    'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile',  # Read your profile info
    'openid'  # Basic login
]

# You can add more scopes if you want more permissions.
# Example: 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.labels' lets the app manage your Gmail labels.

    

# 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.appfolder'
